# Flooring Materials Calculator

Simple Floor replacement calculator. Created for Vanguard Construction LLC estimation process.

This application will take in rooms, and their dimensions. It will then output the total square footage as well and the amount of materials required.

- Added square foot pricing for each material and outputs the cost of the project.
- Added an option if the project requires existing floor removal as well as integrated the pricing into the total amount.

## How to use

- Add new rooms by clicking the "New Rooms" button.
- Remove individual rooms by clicking the "X" button on the corresponding room.
- Clear the full list of rooms with the "Clear" button.
- Click "Calculate" to take all the options and output totals.

- All pricing is hardcoded. May implement a dynamic square foot pricing option in the future.

- Measurement inputs don't currently have integer validation. _In progress_
